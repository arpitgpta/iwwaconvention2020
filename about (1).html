				<div class="History-div">
				<p>
				<b>Patna</b>, anciently known as <b>Pataliputra</b> is the Capital and largest city of the state of Bihar in India. Patna is the second-largest city in Eastern India after Kolkata. As per 2011 census, the population of the city was 1.68 million, making it the 19th Largest City in India. Patna also serves as the seat of Patna High Court.</p>
				<br>
				<p>One of the oldest continuously inhabited places in the world, Patna was founded in 490 BC by the king of Magadha. Ancient Patna, known as Patliputra, was the capital of the Magadh empire under the Haryanka, Nanda, Mauryan, Shunga, Gupta and Pala empires. Pataliputra was a seat of learning and fine arts. Patliputra was home to many astronomers and scholars including Aryabhata, Vātsyāyana and Chanakya. Its population during the Maurya period (around 300 BCE) was about 400,000. Patna served as the seat of power, political and cultural centre of Indian Subcontinent during the Maurya and Gupta empires.  With the fall of Gupta Empire, Patna lost its glory. It was revived again in the 17th century by the British as a centre of international trade. Following the partition of Bengal presidency in 1912, Patna became the capital of Bihar and Orissa Province.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The modern city of Patna is situated on the southern bank of river 
				Ganges. The city also straddles the rivers Sone, Gandak and Punpun. The city is approximately 35 kilometers (22 miles) in length and 16 to 18 kilometers (9.9 to 11.2 mi) wide. In June 2009, the World Bank ranked Patna as second in India (after Delhi) for ease of starting a business. As of 2015, Patna's per capita gross domestic product is 1,06,000 ($1581). Using figures for assumed average annual growth, Patna is the 21st fastest growing city in the world and 5th fastest growing city in India according to a study by the City Mayors Foundation. Patna registered an average annual growth of 3.72% during 2006-2010. </p>
				<br> 
				<p>The Buddhist, Hindu and Jain pilgrimage centres of Vaishali, Rajgir, 
				Nalanda, Bodh Gaya and Pawapuri are nearby and Patna City is also a sacred city for Sikhs as the tenth Sikh Guru, Guru Gobind Singh was born here.</p>
